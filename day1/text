The Dog and His Bone
A dog was crossing a brigde.
He had a bone in his mouth.
He was looking down the stream and saw another dog with a bone in his mouth.
"Hmm! That dog has a bone, too. His bone looks bigger than mine."
"Bark! Bark Give me the bone."
Oh, the poor greedy dog!
His bone was gone forever.
